    <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>I am a hardworking and organized person. I know how to manage and organize the work process. I recognize what the responsibility is because I was liable for the important tasks in the national security domain. I have got an eye for detail – in my previous job it was very important to focus on all the facts and check their accuracy. I have the ability to work in a team, and certainly, I have leadership skills, I can motivate people, set a clear goal, and explain how to achieve it. Also, I have good communication and analytical skills, I know how to listen, and can accurately put across my own ideas.</p>
        <p>I share the view that the future will be inseparably connected with information technology, and I will be very glad to become a part of your team. I’ll try to do my best to show my strong management and analytical skills and qualities such as responsibility, creativity, stress resistance, reliability, and recently completed business analysis course will allow me to start working immediately. I have a great desire to improve myself and inexhaustible optimism, which will help me to harmoniously join your team.</p>
